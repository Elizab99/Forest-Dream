     <p> They use dance as a way to celebrate any occasion. you can also hear the sounds of the wind and sound of the animals.you can hear the water from the water fall that is near us .we are also the only ones that live in this rainforest so it's not nosy.The weather in lacandon is usually sunny and we get rainy weather which is good for the crop and lving things. If you were to come to Lacandon you would hear music and cheers because we are happy people and like to have fun or you would hear silence because we are hiding from danger. </p>
